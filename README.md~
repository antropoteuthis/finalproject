# Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project targets the representation of dependence relationships between quantitative cnidomic traits in siphonophore species, while simultaneously keeping track of the phylogenetic relationships between the species. It will alternate views of the data by shifting the variables plotted in the scatterplot on demand, using movement and color to maintain the continuity of the identity of the species. A node-hinged polyline will connect the dots as they move through the phenotypic hyperspace.

To view this project, ... (embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).

## The data

The data includes node-parent realtionships, species names, determination of tip or node class, 5 quantitative cnidomic variables.
The parent node cnidomic variables were reconstructed using the mean values from the descendant nodes/tips.
Branch length will be flexibly adjusted by the x,y position of the nodes/tips.

## Background

Phylogenetic trees have been around since the 19th century, and naturalists have been tagging the species (tips)
Examples of previous visualizations of similar data or processes, if any exist... Include links or add images to markdown document... how were data mapped to aesthetics in these previous approaches? Was there filtering?

Shortcomings of previous approaches, or potentially interesting gaps between previous approaches...

## This project

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

Each node/tip will be a circle, of fixed radius. the fill will be determined by a dictionary of colors dependent on the species name.
Each node will be accompanied by a text label. Its content will be the species/clade name.
X, Y

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
